Welcome to JustFLAC
===================

What the heck?
--------------

It isn't a fish, it's just a fork of the popular jFLAC decoder. 

Why fork jFLAC?
---------------

jFLAC hasn't been updated in a long time and does not support certain formats like 24-bit/192kHz. The decoder also has a few minor bugs. So this project adds support for a new format extension and fixes some bugs.

JustFLAC is already used in MediaChest and Music-Barrel (Java programs) giving life to audiophile quality formats previously supported only by Foobar and DeaDBeeF (C programs).

Where to find the FLAC standard?
